## ABSTRACT
While bicyclists can legally use most streets, rarely are streets accommodating to bicyclists with adequate infrastructure or other traffic countermeasures. Often, there is a sparse patchwork of isolated bicycle “friendly” streets in an urban network, severely limiting potential bicycle ridership across the network. Current industry standard tools for evaluating bicycle level of service are generally microscopic in approach, focusing on individual intersections or segments. There is a need to equip practitioners with a tool and methodology to evaluate an entire bicycle network effectiveness that is generalizable across different locations. This research aims to resolve that by combining mathematical functions from graph theory with knowledge regarding general preferences and behavior of bicyclists into a methodology for measuring bicycle network effectiveness in a study area. The study tested simple to advanced graph theories and ranked the algorithms to measure network connectivity. The analysis indicates the proposed weighted shortest path graph algorithms: Low-stress Vs. Motor networks (LMN) and Bicycle facilities Vs. Motor Networks (BMN) algorithms provide a solid understanding of the connectivity compared to simple and advanced graph theories. Based on the connectivity score threshold, we proposed five different grades of network connectivity classification (poor, fair, well, very well, and excellent). This study used nine Bay Area counties, Davis, and Hayward cities OpenStreetMap from California, to test the algorithms. Analysis indicates that our proposed novel algorithm is simple and robust enough to calculate network connectivity and provide directions for future network improvement. The developed methods/tool will help planners, engineers, and policymakers with the ability to efficiently evaluate bicycle network connectivity.
